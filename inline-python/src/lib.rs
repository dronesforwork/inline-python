//! Inline Python code directly in your Rust code.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! #![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]
//! use inline_python::python;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let who = "world";
//!     let n = 5;
//!     python! {
//!         for i in range('n):
//!             print(i, "Hello", 'who)
//!         print("Goodbye")
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # How to use
//!
//! Use the `python!{..}` macro to write Python code direcly in your Rust code.
//! You'll need to add `#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]`, and use a nightly
//! version of the compiler that supports this feature.
//!
//! ## Tokens
//!
//! The tokens need to be valid rust tokens, which means you cannot use
//! single-quoted strings, should use `//`-comments instead of `#`-comments,
//! cannot use `u""`-strings, etc.
//!
//! A later version of this crate will provide workarounds for some of these
//! things.
//!
//! ## Using Rust variables
//!
//! To reference rust variables, use `'var`, as shown in the example above.
//! `var` needs to implement [`pyo3::ToPyObject`].
//!
//! ## Getting information back
//!
//! Right now, this crate provides no easy way to get information from the
//! Python code back into Rust. Support for that will be added in a later
//! version of this crate.
